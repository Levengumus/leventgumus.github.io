<div class="about-me">
  <p>
    I am a microeconomist with a research in belief formation and decision-making. I integrate insights from neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and economics in my research. I employ a range of theoretical and empirical methodologies &mdash; including formal modeling, laboratory experiments, and Bayesian methods &mdash; to investigate the mechanisms driving systematic deviations from rational benchmarks and their implications for decision-making in both individual and strategic settings.

  <p>
    I am currently on the job market and available for interviews.

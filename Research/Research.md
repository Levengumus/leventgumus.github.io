  Building on the influential Bayesian brain paradigm in neuroscience (Knill and Pouget, 2004; Doya, 2007), I propose a model of belief updating under noisy signal encoding to study confirmation bias. In the model, a decision-maker (DM) is characterized as facing a mechanism that produces binary signals and forming beliefs about the success probability by observing samples from the mechanism. Modeling belief updating in the log-odds space, I hypothesize that the noise in perceived probabilities, inferred from the observed sample, is proportional to the information costs of belief updating, and modeling the cost function as the expected Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the DM's posterior and prior beliefs, I formally demonstrate that the cost function exhibits a U-shaped relationship with the distance between the decision-maker's prior expectations and the stimuli. As a consequence, greater divergence leads to increased noise in mental representations, which gives rise to confirmation bias in the posterior beliefs. Through comparative statics, I show that the degree of bias intensifies as the divergence increases, driven by the heightened information cost. I, further, conduct an experiment to test the predictions and assumptions of the proposed model. The results provide support for the hypothesis upon which the model is built, as the noise in perceived probabilities appears to be directly proportional to the divergence between the DM's initial expectations and the stimuli.

   We develop a novel method that allows us to econometrically recover belief distributions from binary choices between bets on different events. We delpoy the method in a strategic context by studying the predictive power of the recovered beliefs about reciprocity on trust. We econometrically recover two measures: a measure of the mean belief of the decision-maker; and a measure of the subjective uncertainty surrounding that mean belief. We show that mean beliefs are a significant predictor of trusting behaviour. Belief uncertainty, however, plays an even more important role in explaining behaviour. We illustrate this by estimating the generalized Arrow-Pratt approximation of our `trust equivalents' under model uncertainty proposed by Maccheroni, Marinacci, and Ruffino (2014). We find aversion to model uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty characterizing the trustor's own belief distribution) to be the single most important driver of trust. This showcases the role of the dispersion of the belief distribution when it comes to explaining behaviour in strategic interactions, and supports multiple-prior models of decision-making under ambiguity.
